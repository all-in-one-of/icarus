First place the AdvancedSkeleton4 folder where you want it to be.
for example: "C:/Users/YOU/Documents/maya/scripts/AdvancedSkeleton4".

This folder is a good place to keep it, but it can be anywhere.
If you want to share AdvancedSkeleton with other users over the network, you place it on a network drive.

Once you have the AdvancedSkeleton4 folder where you want it to be,
then just drag`n`drop the "install.mel" file into Maya (drop in any viewport).

This will add the AdvancedSkeleton4 tool to the current shelf.

AdvancedSkeleton4 works with all versions of Maya, on Windows, Mac & linux.
